# dotoList - Pure JavaScript to-do list.
This Javascript project was made completely from scratch without a framework, for learning purposes. It's yet another to-do list, that does nothing unusual, it works like you think it would. You are able to add notes with given title and actual note content. You can set a priority on your note, ranging from green being the least important to red being the most urgent. It automatiacally adds a timestamp so you can easily track how long ago you added the note.
